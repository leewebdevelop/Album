# WHAT IS Processing?

Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. Since 2001, Processing has promoted software literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within technology. There are tens of thousands of students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists who use Processing for learning and prototyping.


# Background to project 

Many Studies have investigated if individual personality can have an affect on music preference. The majority of studies investigated, through the use of questionaires, the correlation between the big five personality traits and musical preferecnes.

The Big Five personality traits is a suggested grouping for personality traits (Roccas, Sagiv, Schwartz, & Knafo, 2002), where these factors are
    
    • openness to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)
    • conscientiousness (efficient/organised vs. extravagant/careless)
    • extraversion (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)
    • agreeableness (friendly/compassionate vs. challenging/callous)
    • neuroticism (sensitive/nervous vs. resilient/confident)
    
   
   
    
    
 In this project I explored this idea using an external data set in CSV format to probe (disclaimer not in a very scientific way) personality traits by asking the user to chose between two songs.
 Once the user selects a couple of songs the sketch will present a personality trait profile.
 
 Based off the above paper 
 
   • Openness to experience prefer more complex and novel music such as classical, jazz, and eclecticism, as well as intense and rebellious music (alternative, rock and heavy metal).
   
   • Extroversion prefer upbeat and conventional music, as well as energetic and rhythmic music, such as rap, hip hop, soul, electronic, and dance music.
   
   • Conscientiousness dislike intense and rebellious music. Agreeableness prefer upbeat and conventional music.
   
   • Neuroticism dislike intense and rebellious music and prefer upbeat and conventional music, such as country, sound tracks, and pop music.
